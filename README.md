# Pathfinder algorithm for tower wars game
## Pathfinder algorithm for tower wars game written with use of C# and Unity editor


This project is a program for generating a shortest path between point A and point B of a square field NxN where N is any number. This algorithm is based on an algorithm of Breadth-first search (BFS), an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property.
